## Walkthrough
Following same procedure as Some Assembly Required 2 we get to the pseudocode of the wasm file. There too we notice changes in the same copy function. Upon spending a lot of time on understanding the code we get that the function takes a and XOR it with an element from the array at memory address '1067' and stores it at memory address '1072 + b' which is given to us in the data as an array of hexes. Converting the code to C ,we get the array of hexes both the encoded flag and the key to XORed with. flag=[0x9d, 0x6e, 0x93, 0xc8, 0xb2, 0xb9, 0x41, 0x8b, 0xc5, 0xc6, 0xdd, 0x61, 0x93, 0xc3, 0xc2, 0xda, 0x3f, 0xc7, 0x93, 0xc1, 0x8b, 0x31, 0x95, 0x93, 0x93, 0x8e, 0x62, 0xc8, 0x94, 0xc9, 0xd5, 0x64, 0xc0, 0x96, 0xc4, 0xd9, 0x37, 0x93, 0x93, 0xc2, 0x90, 0x00, 0x00] this is what we get for the encrytped flag. key =[0xf1, 0xa7, 0xf0, 0x07, 0xed] these are the keys. The keys are not ordered so to order them we have to manually decode the first 4 through trial and error and then reorder the keys array for the proper functioning.

The following code exectues the logic suggested: 
import pwn
flag=[0x9d, 0x6e, 0x93, 0xc8, 0xb2, 0xb9, 0x41, 0x8b, 0x94, 0xc6, 0xdf, 0x33,
  0xc0, 0xc5, 0x95, 0xde, 0x37, 0xc3, 0x9f, 0x93, 0xdf, 0x3f, 0xc9, 0xc3,
  0xc2, 0x8c, 0x32, 0x93, 0x90, 0xc1, 0x8e, 0x65, 0x95, 0x9f, 0xc2, 0x8c,
  0x36, 0xc8, 0x95, 0xc0, 0x90, 0x00, 0x00]
check=[0xed,0x07,0xf0,0xa7,0xf1]
index=0
real=""
for i in flag:
    if index>4:
        index=0
    print(chr(i^check[index]),end="")
    index+=1
